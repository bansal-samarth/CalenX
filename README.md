2. Transparency: The application enhances organizational transparency by allowing higher-ups to view employees' schedules, promoting better coordination and planning.
3. Restricted Access: To maintain privacy, only a select few higher-ups have the authority to schedule events on an employee's calendar.
4. Maintained Balance: CALENX ensures a healthy work-life balance by preventing any scheduling during designated break times.
4. Notifications: Employees receive instant notifications for any changes made to their schedule by administrators, keeping everyone informed and up-to-date.
